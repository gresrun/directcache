DirectCache
======

DirectCache is currently a very simple attempt at creating an off-heap cache ala [Terracotta/Ehcache BigMemory](http://www.terracotta.org/bigmemory).

DirectCache is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project and depends on nothing.

***

How do I use it?
----------------
Download the latest source at:

	https://github.com/gresrun/directcache
Or, to use it in your Maven project, add it as a dependency: (Coming Soon!)

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.greghaines</groupId>
	<artifactId>directcache</artifactId>
	<version>0.1.0</version>
	<type>jar</type>
	<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```
